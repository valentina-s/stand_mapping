We consolidated the land cover typology used by each agency and forester into the following five classes:\r\n","\r\n","* 1 = Water\r\n","* 2 = Forest\r\n","* 3 = Field\r\n","* 4 = Barren/Non-vegetated\r\n","* 5 = Developed\r\n","\r\n","Each observation in the training and validation datasets represents a stand that was hand-delineated (typically using high-resolution aerial imagery) by a professional forester. Each stand is summarized using a histogram of values (each with 16 bins) depicting the distribution of pixel values within that stand from several input layers.\r\n","\r\n","There are 15 image channels summarized for each superpixel:\r\n","* NAIP aerial imagery (4-channel: R,G,B,NIR)\r\n","* LANDSAT leaf-on imagery (4-channel: R,G,B,NIR)\r\n","* 4 terrain channels (elevation, slope, and topographic position index at 300m and 2000m)\r\n","* 3 channels depicting the distance from hydrological features, roads, and buildings, clipped to the range of 0-100 meters. \r\n","\r\n","For each tile (approximately 5000 x 7000-meter footprint), we randomly selected 10 stands to include in the training and validation subsets. 80% of the tiles available from each agency were included in the training set, and 20% were used for validation. This split helps to ensure that the different forest types related to the agencies are well-reflected in both training and validation datasets.\r\n","\r\n","Once we have trained a decent classification model using these data, we will utilize it to (re-)assign land cover types to each area delineated by foresters across Oregon and Washington. This approach helps to ensure that land cover classifications are made consistently within and between datasets created by different foresters, and to update cover types in the original datasets that appear to be out-of-date (e.g., where cover typing was done before the year in which the agency released the data and does not reflect harvest or other disturbance that may be apparent from the imagery)."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"_wqTxtaEp5rE","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1613426700126,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":1522,"user":{"displayName":"David D Diaz","photoUrl":"","userId":"04126922794502874183"}},"outputId":"ad8ca797-7ca4-462e-cf08-8c4b112bf092"},"source":["from google.colab import drive\r\n","drive.mount('/content/drive', force_remount=True)"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"7nh90rCLqFKM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1613426700637,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":2020,"user":{"displayName":"David D Diaz","photoUrl":"","userId":"04126922794502874183"}},"outputId":"35f70810-94be-4334-a6b6-0f71ffc4e6ac"},"source":["import os\r\n","import glob\r\n","import numpy as np\r\n","from collections import Counter\r\n","import pandas as pd\r\n","import joblib\r\n","\r\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\r\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\r\n","from sklearn.metrics import plot_confusion_matrix, log_loss\r\n","from imblearn.metrics import classification_report_imbalanced\r\n","\r\n","from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\r\n","%matplotlib inline"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/sklearn/externals/six.py:31: FutureWarning: The module is deprecated in version 0.21 and will be removed in version 0.23 since we've dropped support for Python 2.7.
